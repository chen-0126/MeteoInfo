**MeteoInfo** is an intergrated framework both for GIS application (**MeteoInfoMap**) and scientific computation environment (**MeteoInfoLab**), especially for meteorological community.

**MeteoInfoMap** is a GIS application which enables the user to visualize and analyze
the spatial and meteorological data with multiple data formats.

**MeteoInfoLib** is a Java library providing main functions of MeteoInfoMap and MeteoInfoLab.

It requires that Java 8 or greater be installed on your computer. See the
http://www.java.com website for a free download of Java if you do not have it
already installed.
